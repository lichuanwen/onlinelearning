PHP LIVE! MANUAL PRE INSTALL STEPS
===========================================

A server may require a manual pre installation step due to the configuration. These
steps are generally not required UNLESS you were directed here from the web installer.

-------------------------------------------

Step 1.
----------------
Remove ALL the files and folders located within the phplive/web/ directory.
It is important that the phplive/web/ directory is completely empty.


Step 2.
----------------
Within the phplive/web/ directory, create the following sub directories:

chat_initiate
chat_sessions
patches


Step 3.
----------------
Set the permissions on all of the folders you've just created to be fully read and writeable by
the web server.

[ METHODS TO SET PERMISSIONS ]

* FTP METHOD

Right click on each of the folders created and choose the "File Permissions" or "Permissions".
Check ALL the boxes and submit.  Double check the parent folder phplive/web/ has all permissions
checked as well.

* WINDOWS SERVER METHOD

On a Windows IIS system, set the NTFS permissions for the phplive/web/ directory and its contents
to "Full Control" for the Web User account.  Double check that the folders created
(chat_initiate, chat_sessions, patches) are set to full contol as well.


Step 4.
----------------
Access the web installer again and it should begin the installation process instead of loading this
page.  Web installer can be accessed <a href="../setup/">here</a>.
