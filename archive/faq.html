 You may notice that some online courses associate a set day and time for the course. This is simply to accommodate our registration system. You can access your site anytime after the start date, providing you register before the course starts.&nbsp;            </span></td>

            <ul class="formatting">
  <li>Participate:
    <ul class="formatting2">
      <li>Stay in contact with your teacher and your  classmates through the discussion board and other activities.&nbsp; Participation often contributes to your final  grade. </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Know your deadlines:</li>
  <ul class="formatting2">
    <li>Most online courses at Humber  are NOT self-paced.&nbsp; Look for a critical  path or a table of deadlines when you first login to your course site.</li>
    <li>If you feel you can&rsquo;t meet a deadline, let your  teacher know as soon as possible &ndash; don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute as it is  often harder to accommodate your request then.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <li>Be patient:</li>
  <ul class="formatting2">
    <li>You have access to the course site 24x7, but  remember your teacher and classmates are not sitting at the other end waiting  for your email or discussion posting. Give them time to reply.&nbsp; Usually, you can expect a response within 48 hours or sooner. </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <li>Be organized:</li>
  <ul class="formatting2">
    <li>Manage your time appropriately.&nbsp; As a guideline, you should give yourself  about 2-3 hours per week to work through the course content and another 3-4  hours per week to complete assignments and participate in discussions and  online activities. <br />
      <br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Read:</li>
  <ul class="formatting2">
    <li>It is very easy to skim information on the web,  but it is important that you read through the material in your course site to  ensure a positive learning experience. </li>
  </ul>

This will be available through the online <a href="http://www.srs.humber.ca" target="_blank">STUDENT RECORD SERVICES</a> system. Once logged in, choose "My Tax Form" and the appropriate year.
