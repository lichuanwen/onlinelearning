Workshop Title: "That's So Gay!" <br />
Presenter: Maureen Carnegie and Linda Hill <br />
</p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> Creating positive, inclusive space within classrooms and the College environment is important.  Ignoring homophobic language, for example, can marginalize gay and lesbian students and lead to a culture of disrespect for many diverse groups.  The newly formed Gender and Sexual Diversity Committee wants to support Humber in creating an inclusive environment for all LGBTTIQQ employees and students through outreach, education and training.  Currently, the Committee is working on a Positive Space campaign and Anti-Homophobia Tool Kit.  We need your input! If you care about equity and making everyone at Humber feel part of a caring academic community, come to this interactive workshop and share your thoughts and ideas. This workshop will be facilitated as a focus group with the aim to learn from faculty and staff what resources would be helpful in the quest for positive space. Come with examples of best practices and how you create positive space OR share classroom experiences.  Everyone is welcome! </p>

Presenter: Leon King, Bernie Monette,  et al. <br /></p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> Whenever we use the Web we leave a footprint.   Analytics refers to the technique of gathering this information and making sense of it.In the seminar participant will learn what kind of information can be gathered, and the kinds of stories it can tell.    We'll look at what Analytics tells us about the users of Humber's web sites and how Analytics can be woven into the curriculum. The material will be of interest both to a technical and non-technical audience.  The only background needed is experience in surfing the web. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Leon King has been teaching at Humber in the Computer Engineering Program since 1983.  My interest in the Internet is in both its  architecture and  implications of its ability to reflect collective thinking.  That it could do so became apparent during the 2004 faculty strike, and therein hangs a tale...

Presenter: Jean Choi, Rebecca Milburn; Brett Reynolds<br /></p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> When most of us think of mathematics, we think of numbers and symbols: a universal language.  However, this is not always the case.  In our research, we found that the way questions are framed affect ELLs differentially compared to their non-ELL peers.
</p>

<p>
We will describe the process of our projects, from the formation of our inter-disciplinary team to the many opportunities and experiences that our collaboration has yielded for each of us. We hope that our experiences will lead workshop participants to reflect upon their own teaching practices and methods regardless of the course topic, particularly when considering their ELL students.

Employers invest in the development of their human resources and demonstrate leadership in corporate social responsibility. Employees put their knowledge and skills to work in an international development project, expand their personal and professional horizons and acquire a deeper understanding of broader global issues. This presentation is a feedback to the Humber Community of  three-overseas volunteer experiences. 
</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">The three presenters have participated in the L4C (Leave for Change) program. They put together their overseas volunteering experience to assemble this presentation.

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> In today's academic environment faculty members are no longer the sole source of content, but the interpreter of content.

Interactive whiteboards offer two very useful features through web and I-Pad apps -- recording and collaboration. Content recording allow students to review material after the class to make sure their notes are correct and adequate and at an adjustable pace. Some whiteboard applications are appropriate solutions to extraordinary collaboration. Web whiteboard based collaboration allows teachers and learners to communicate beyond the boundaries of traditional tools. In this session we'll explore the possibilities this new technology opens up.

Workshop Title: Weight loss: Why is it so difficult to keep it off?<br />
Presenters: Sergiu Fediuc<br />
</p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> One of the most common health related goals for many individuals living in western societies is weight loss.  Manipulating the diet by restricting caloric intake and increasing caloric expenditure through exercise has traditionally been the most successful method of achieving this goal.  However, once the target weight is reached, keeping the weight off permanently is a big challenge that most individuals fail at.  This lecture will discuss how the human body adapts to weight loss, common misconceptions about metabolic regulation during times of caloric restriction, and the role of exercise in maintaining a healthy weight.

<span class="headings">Description:</span> Humber's Police Foundation and Crime Scene Investigation programs have curriculum and facilities that rival those of educational and policing organizations across the country.

Participate as a novice investigator, witness, assistant Crown or defence counsel, juror, or even… the accused.

Our intent to is turn the traditional learning paradigm upside down with students teaching fundamental investigative and courtroom skills to teachers. Through their interaction with students, participants will be able to assess the effectiveness of this type of strategy.

Workshop Title: Classrooms Got Talent: Students as Teachers<br />
Presenter: Mark Macdonald<br /></p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> So many students, so little time. Let your students become your agents, receiving marks for transmitting your lessons in such performance skills as presentations, counseling, special education and conflict resolution. 
Class sizes limit the teacher's ability to engage in individual instruction, group simulations and role-play. When teachers have enlisted students to provide commentary on role-play sessions, their unguided observations can become shallow and brief. Yet, student facilitation of peer skill performance can be very rewarding, if the teacher can build a guiding structure and reward students for accurate and constructive feedback.

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">As faculty at Humber College and more recently at the University of Guelph-Humber, Mark has applied Behavioural and Social Learning theory to post secondary teaching techniques toward counseling for highly verbal, minority or developmentally delayed populations.

Workshop Title: Creating Participation: What Music Shares With Education<br />
Presenter: Mark Whale<br /></p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> How could teaching science, politics or business be said to be musical? Violinist and educator, Mark Whale, will demonstrate how music is comprised of components – pitch, duration, dynamics, etc.  The components are arranged into patterns. Played "correctly," the patterns sound like music …or do they? Education is also comprised of components – facts, concepts and skills. Without these components nothing is learned. But where learning is about "facts concepts and skills" alone, there is no education. Education, like music, is irreducible to its components but has to do with the relationship between teacher and students as they build shared understanding.  Without this sharing education is unmusical.  
</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Mark Whale, PhD, studied the violin at the Royal Academy of Music, London, UK.

Workshop Title: Finding Donna Lee<br />
Presenter: Andrew Scott, Pat Labarbera<br /></p>

<p class="description">
<span class="headings">Description:</span> Contrafacts--compositions whose melody and lyrics are original but whose form and harmony are borrowed--historically provided a way for musicians to record familiar music, while sidestepping issues of intellectual appropriation.

Famous among contrafacts is "Donna Lee," a line based upon "Indiana." The authorship of "Donna Lee" is contested with credit attributed to Charlie Parker and, more commonly, Miles Davis. Absent, however, is any mention of Tiny Kahn's "Tiny's Con," a 1946 composition that evidences striking similarities to the line Davis recorded (and was awarded authorship of) one year later.
